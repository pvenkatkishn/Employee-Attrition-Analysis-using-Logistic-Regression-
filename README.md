**<h1>Employee Attrition Analysis with Logistic Regression</h1>**   

Project Overview
This project explores employee attrition using **logistic regression**. The objective is to predict which employees are likely to leave the company based on various features and analyze the factors contributing to attrition.

1. Key Features
- Application of Logistic Regression to model employee attrition.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Interpretation of key predictors and their impact on attrition through odds ratios.
- Practical recommendations for reducing employee turnover based on data insights.

2. Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
- **numpy** for numerical computations.
- **pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **matplotlib** and seaborn for data visualization.
- **sklearn** for logistic regression and performance evaluation.

4. Results
- âœ… Employees working overtime are **2.6 times more likely to leave**.
- ðŸ’¡ Frequent business travel is associated with **higher attrition rates**.
   
6. Model Limitations: High overall accuracy but low recall for predicting actual attrition cases.

7. Recommendations:
- Reduce overtime and balance workloads.
- Reevaluate travel policies to improve employee satisfaction.
   
7. Future Enhancements
- Explore additional features like employee engagement scores and manager feedback.
- Apply advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost) for better predictive accuracy.
- Automate the end-to-end pipeline for real-time attrition monitoring.
